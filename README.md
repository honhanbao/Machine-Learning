## 1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin: 
   ### About Dataset
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
   
   Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
   n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

   This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:
   ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu
   cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/

Also can be found on UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
   ### My project on Kaggle:

   ### Description:
   
   In this project, Logistic Regression has been use to predict whether a person has presence of breast cancer based on physical features of cell nucleus of that person.
